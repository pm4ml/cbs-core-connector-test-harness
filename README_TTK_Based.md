# ML Core Banking System Core Connector Test Harness
A development and testing harness for core connectors that support the P2P cross currency use case in a Mojaloop scheme


# Pre-requisites
Before you go through this test harness documentation, the following are required for you to be able to go through it successfully

- Working knowledge of RESTful APIs
- Docker 
- Git

# Overview 
This test harness is intended to provide a core connector testing and development framework. The idea of a core connector came about as a result of the need to have an integration middlewear between the Mojaloop Connector and a Financial Service Provider (FSP) Core Banking System.

# Getting Started

To run this test stack run the following commands

> By default this runs with the Mifos Core Connector

Clone this repository using git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mojaloop/cbs-core-connector-test-harness.git
```

Navigate into the directory using this command 

```bash
cd cbs-core-connector-test-harness
```

Run this command to bootstrap the test harness.


```bash
docker compose up
```

Or in detachced mode

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

At this point you have run the test harness using the Mifos Core Connector as the core connector under test. This is because by default it is the core connector configured. More info on how to develop and configure your own core connector in the coming sections.

Open the TTK UI using this url http://localhost:6060

# Developing a Core Connector
To develop a core connector, it is important to understand the different apis that the core connector needs to expose and those it needs to consume to support receipt and initiation of payments in a Mojaloop scheme.

Here is a diagram that illustrates role of a core connector in a typical mojaloop payments scheme

![CBS Integratio Overview](./assets/CBS%20Integration%20Overview.png)

In the illustration, we see the core connector being used as an adaptor between the FSP Core Banking System and the Mojaloop Connector to facilitate payments. 

A core connector is an api server that receives requests from the mojaloop connector and brokers them to your core banking system and vice versa to perform payment operations.

The core connector is supposed to implement and expose two apis for it to be able to effectively support payment operations in a mojaloop scheme.

# Incoming Payments - Payee

Below is an architecture diagram that shows how a core connector supports payee receipt of funds from a mojaloop scheme in this test harness.

![Payee Architecture](./assets/CBS%20Integration%20Diagrams-Payee%20Architectural%20Flow.drawio.png)

In this architecture the core connector is shown as a stateless synchronous api that supports the crediting of funds into an beneficiaries account.

The Mojaloop connector and the switch are simulated using TTK. To support incoming transactions, the core connector should implement the backend api for the Mojaloop connector.

There is also a core banking solution sandbox which represents a financial service provider's core banking solution UAT environment.

When executing test cases on your core connector, for different test cases it is important that a quality assurance personal observes the changing state of account balances to validate that the core connector is indeed functioning as intended for both happy path and non happy paths.

Please find the api schema for the mojaloop connector backend api at this location. The core connector needs to expose an api that will be invoked by the Mojaloop Connector api to receive payments from the mojaloop scheme. The api needs to be in sync with the api definition in this api definition.

```bash
./resources/api-spec/sdk-scheme-adapter-backend-v2_1_0-openapi3-snippets.yaml
```

Here is a [link](./resources/api-spec/sdk-scheme-adapter-backend-v2_1_0-openapi3-snippets.yaml) to the api schema file

When an inbound payment is received by the  mojaloop connector, it will make requests to your core connector to perform account lookup, quoting and transfers.

The core connector needs to respond to the api calls described in the open api specification for payee.

# Outgoing Payments - Payer
Here is another illustration that shows how the core connector should be used to support out going payments i.e Payments that are initiated from your customers.

![](./assets/CBS%20Integration%20Diagrams-Payer%20Architectural%20Flow.drawio.png)

In this architecture, the core connector is shown as a stateless synchronous api that brokers initiation of payments through the mojaloop connector.

To initiate payments to a beneficiary whose account is held in another financial service provider, the core connector would need to make requests to the outbound api of the mojaloop connector.

As you develop your connector, it is important that your core connector conforms to this scheme to inititate payment requests through the mojaloop connector.

Please find the api schema for the mojaloop connector outgoing api at the this location

```bash
./resources/api-spec/sdk-scheme-adapter-outbound-v2_1_0-openapi3-snippets.yaml
```

Here is a [link](/resources/api-spec/sdk-scheme-adapter-outbound-v2_1_0-openapi3-snippets.yaml) to the api schema file

We have also designed a send money RESTful api which your core banking solution can use to send transfer requests to your core connector. 

This send money api definition encaptuates the scheme requirements for this use case. It is recommeded that your core connector implements and exposes that API so that your core banking solution can use it to initiate send money and merchant payment requests. Alternatively you may choose to implement a custom API based off this API

Please find the send money api schema at this location

```bash
./resources/api-spec/payer.yaml
```

Here is a [link](/resources/api-spec/payer.yaml) to the api schema file
Here is an architecture to illustrate how all the different apis line up in the integration setup.

![API Overview](./assets//CBS%20Integration%20Diagrams-APIOverview.drawio.png)


# Core Connector Networking

The core connector needs to expose services on two ports, one port listening for requests from your core banking solution and the other listening for requests from the mojaloop connector


To support testing, the core connector should expose these two ports.

- `3003` for receiving requests from the Mojaloop connector
- `3004` for receiving requests from your Core banking solution

When developing and testing your core connector, make all requests to this base url http://localhost:4040/sdk-out-v2-1/  after running the test harness to initiate outbound payments through the mojaloop connector's outbound api

Refer to the [Setup](#setup) section to learn more about how to run the test harness.

Use it as the base url for all paths detailed in the api schema for outgoing payments payee api.

You can set it as an environment variable and access it within your core connector source code. 

# The Reference Core Connector (Mifos)
A reference core connector has been built for the open source core banking system called Apache Fineract built by [The Mifos Initiative](https://mifos.org) and maintained by [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/)

For benchmarking purposes, you can refer to the [Mifos Core Connector](https://github.com/mojaloop/mifos-core-connector?tab=readme-ov-file#mifos-core-connector) to draw inspiration for your custom core connector.



# Testing your Core Connector

Once you have developed the core connector, it will need to be tested to verify that it works as expected.

To test your core connector, you will need to package it as a docker image using a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)

Here is an example Dockerfile that you can adapt to your specific core connector. It is the Dockerfile used in the mifos core connector to build a docker image.

```Dockerfile
## *Builder*
FROM node:lts-alpine as builder

RUN apk add --no-cache git python3 build-base

## Create app directory
WORKDIR /opt/app

## Copy basic files for installing dependencies
COPY tsconfig.json package.json package-lock.json /opt/app/
COPY src /opt/app/src

RUN npm ci

## Build the app
RUN npm run build


## *Application*
FROM node:lts-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache git python3 g++ make
WORKDIR /opt/app

COPY package.json package-lock.json* /opt/app/

RUN npm ci --production

## Copy of dist directory from builder
COPY --from=builder /opt/app/dist/ ./dist/
COPY --from=builder /opt/app/src/api-spec ./src/api-spec

## Expose any application ports
# EXPOSE <PORT>

CMD [ "npm" , "start" ]
```

To build a docker image for your newly built core connector. You will need to add a Dockerfile to your project source code if you already haven't 

Consider this directory structure of a hypothetical core connector

```bash
core_connector
├── src
├── tests
├── tsconfig.json
└── package.json

```
You need to add a Dockerfile to the root of your folder and it should now look like this.

```bash
core_connector
├── src
├── tests
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
└── Dockerfile

```
Once you have added a Dockerfile to your core connector. You can build an image for it like this. You can tag it with a name of choice using the `-t` option. 

```bash
docker build -t cbs-core-connector:local . 
```

After building the image, you will need to configure it into the docker-compose.yaml of this test harness. Here is the link to the [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml)

```bash
./docker-compose.yaml
```

Open the docker-compose.yaml in an editor of your choice and edit the following line to reference your built core connector.

```yaml
services:
  coreConnectorUnderTest: 
    build:
      context: ./src/
    image: mojaloop/mifos-core-connector # edit this line
    networks:
      - mojaloop-net
    env_file: .env.example
    ports:
      - "3003:3003" 
      - "3004:3004" 
``` 

Edit that line to the name you tagged the docker image at the building step. It should look like this after editing the docker-compose.yaml.

Update the .env.example file with all the environment variables that are required the core connector going to be tested.
```yaml
services:
  coreConnectorUnderTest: 
    build:
      context: ./src/
    image: cbs-core-connector:local # edited line
    networks:
      - mojaloop-net
    env_file: .env.example
    ports:
      - "3003:3003" 
      - "3004:3004" 
```

After editing the docker-compose.yml, now you can run the test harness. This time it will be bootstrapped using your newly built core connector.

```bash
docker compose up 
```

Or in detached mode

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

# Core Banking System and TTK Environment Setup

To execute test cases on your core connector, you will need to create some accounts and configure them into the TTK UI to support the tests.

Create these accounts in your core banking system
- An Invalid Account
- A Valid Account
- A disabled Account 
- An account with transaction threshold (If supported by CBS)

Make sure to note the account numbers or identifiers depending the your preferred account id type.

After creating these accounts, you will need to configure them in TTK Environment Variables such that they are used as part of the test cases being executed.

Open the TTK UI using this link. http://localhost:6060

> Make sure the test harness is running with your core connector
